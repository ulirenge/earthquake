# supreme-octo-parakeet
At 5:37 (+8ULT)today, an earthquake lasted for about 1 minute on Baga Toiruu Street in Ulaanbaatar. I was awake, shaking, and very uncomfortable. I live on the 8th floor, and the lights in my room are hanging, and everything else, including the 13th floor apartment where I live, is shaking. Posted by: Enkhjargal
